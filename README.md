## The Class ##

We go over Rails and the web. I try to place our development in between cutting-edge and how people do it now. The class is four weeks long, and after that just specific office hours (TBA) for things you want your apps to do

## VM Connection ##

You will be assigned a VM (virtual machine). The virtual machine is where your server runs so that you may test your application while you are developing. This relieves you of setting up your own machine. This class will not cover setting up Rails on your own machine. You will login with your credentials through SSH.

### Unix(OSX/Ubuntu) ###

Open Terminal(the Terminal on your computer) and type the following:
```
ssh myusername@vmname.cloudapp.net
```
You will be prompted for a password. Enter it. Your prompt will change and you should see your VM.

### Windows ###

Windows users will want to download an SSH application. I recommend [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html). Open Putty. in the Host Name box, type:
```
vnmane.cloudapp.net
```
Click open. enter your username and password at the prompt. You should be able to access your machine now.

## Git ##

In order to get our files on the server and to get everyone acquainted with the modern development word, we use git to transfer files from the server to our local computers.
